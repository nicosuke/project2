    <h3>Most of the time She sleeps in a big cage outside the house, she has a favorite corner
      where she will spend the night.
      From 8am she and her friend alex will start screaming untill she is released for her morning excersise,
      which is flying around <br> in the open sky untill she gets tired.
      after the excersise she will eat any fruit in front of her, which is normally a banana or an apple.<br>
      around lunch time she is put in the outside cage where she will walk, climb and destroy wood.
      After another afternoon<br> flight she is brought insde the house to spend quality time with owners
      for many hours.<br>
      Dinner time she will eat human food on top of the dinner table,
      meat, rice, veges and more. <br>
      Afer the meal she will sleep where she is standing, so she has to be shifter to the outside cage or
      optionally to a smaller cage inside the house.

    <h3> Pinkchan came as a baby without feathers, because her parents for some reason
      desided to take them off.
      She was hand raised however, <br>
      she was a little bit agressive at the begining, so we had to cut her feathers short
      so she can behave, we did this only once, the first year of her life,<br> after 6 months
      her feather
      regrown and since then she flies happy and free every day.</h3>
