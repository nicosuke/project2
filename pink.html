            <h3>Most of the time She sleeps in a big cage outside the house, she has a favorite corner
              where she will spend the night.
              From 8am she and her friend alex will start screaming untill she is released for her morning excersise,
              which is flying around <br> in the open sky untill she gets tired.
              after the excersise she will eat any fruit in front of her, which is normally a banana or an apple.<br>
              around lunch time she is put in the outside cage where she will walk, climb and destroy wood.
              After another afternoon<br> flight she is brought insde the house to spend quality time with owners
              for many hours.<br>
              Dinner time she will eat human food on top of the dinner table,
              meat, rice, veges and more. <br>
              Afer the meal she will sleep where she is standing, so she has to be shifter to the outside cage or
              optionally to a smaller cage inside the house.
              </P>

                      <h3> Pinkchan came as a baby without feathers, because her parents for some reason
                        desided to take them off.
                        She was hand raised however, <br>
                        she was a little bit agressive at the begining, so we had to cut her feathers short
                        so she can behave, we did this only once, the first year of her life,<br> after 6 months
                        her feather
                        regrown and since then she flies happy and free every day.</h3>
