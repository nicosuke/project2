         <h3>A Day in her life</h3>
         <P>Most of the time She sleeps in a big cage outside the house, she has a favorite corner
             where she spend the night. <br>
          From 8am she and her "friend" alex will start screaming untill she is released for her morning excersise,
          which is flying around<br> in the open sky untill she gets tired.
          after the excersise she will eat any fruit in front of her, which is normally a banana or an apple.<br>
          around lunch time she is put in the outside cage where she will walk, climb and destroy wood.
          after another afternoon<br> flight she is brought insde the house to spend quality time with humans
          for many hours.<br>
          Dinner time she will eat human food on top of the dinner table suronded by humans feeding her.
          meet, rice, veges and more. <br>
          Afer the meal she will sleep where she is standing, so she has to be shifter to the outside cage or
          optionally to a smaller cage inside the house.
         </P>
